# Grade Average Calculator

# Step 1: Input 5 test scores
scores = []
for i in range(5):
    score = float(input(f"Enter score {i+1}: "))
    scores.append(score)

# Step 2: Calculate average
average = sum(scores) / len(scores)

# Step 3: Determine pass/fail
# You can change the threshold (e.g., 50) as needed
threshold = 40
status = "Pass" if average >= threshold else "Fail"

# Step 4: Print result
print(f"\nAverage Score: {average:.2f}")
print(f"Result: {status}")
